# Redux console

I am reading the redux tutorial and found out that I only want to try the core redux features and its API, the react integration distract my experiment onto the core function. So I made this redux console that contain standalone redux application can run directly on the console via nodejs.

## Run the app

1. Install dependency
```
$ yarn
```

2. Run

```
$ yarn start
```
